# Polaris Companion

The "Polaris For VSCode" extension has a [bug](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris/issues/12780), so I created this working solution for now.

## Installation

1. Download `polaris-companion-0.0.1.vsix` from the repo.
2. Open VSCode and go to Extensions.
3. Click the three-dot menu and select "Install from VSIX..."
4. Find and open the `.vsix` file to install.

It works same as "Polaris For VSCode." extension.
